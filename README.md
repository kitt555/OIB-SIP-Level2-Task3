Developed a to-do web app that enables a user to add daily tasks.

The to-do web app allows users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list are visible in the "All tasks" list irrespective of completion or not. 
A user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks appear on a separate list, named "Completed" Tasks.
Also, added a separate section titled "Pending" Tasks that will list all the tasks that require completion. Overall, the to-do list will be a union of the Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list. Irrespective of the list, a user also will be able to delete or edit tasks from the lists. And, also user can clear the full list at once for the new set of tasks to enter.
